## Smart E-health Services for Treating Patients in Tunisia  
### The Website

The idea of the project is to develop an e-health solution that supports the treatment of chronic diseases
like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma.
It allows us to collect data via a set of sensors, analyze incoming sensor data together with data
extracted from additional sources in the WWW and automatically propose a treatement plan. A medical expert
validates the treatment plan and executes it.
